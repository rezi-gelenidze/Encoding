# KR4 Encoding System

A personal project, KR4 Encoding System is a simple encoding tool developed in the early stages of learning programming. Created as a fun and non-serious method for encoding credentials in text files or papers, it maps the QWERTY keyboard layout to encode and decode text. This project was developed as a teen hobby and serves as a nostalgic piece of my programming journey.

## Overview

The KR4 Encoding System uses a unique method to transform regular text into a coded format based on the QWERTY keyboard layout. It's a Python-based tool, consisting of two main scripts: `KR4CLI.py` for the command-line interface and `KR4module.py` for the core encoding and decoding functions.

### KR4CLI.py

This script provides a user-friendly command-line interface for encoding and decoding text using the KR4 system. It includes options to encode text, decode encoded text, and run tests to ensure the functionality is working correctly.

### KR4module.py

The core module of the KR4 Encoding System, containing the logic for encoding and decoding text. It can be imported and used in other Python scripts if needed.

## Features

- **Text Encoding and Decoding**: Transforms text into a unique encoded format and decodes it back to the original text.
- **QWERTY Keyboard Mapping**: Utilizes a custom mapping based on the QWERTY keyboard layout.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for encoding and decoding operations.
- **Test Functionality**: Includes test cases to validate the encoding and decoding process.

## Usage

To use the KR4 Encoding System, clone this repository and run the `KR4CLI.py` script.

```bash
python KR4CLI.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to encode or decode text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
